# AMR Sentinel – Future Enhancements
This project represents a functional proof-of-concept developed within the Tableau Hackathon timeframe. With additional time and resources, AMR Sentinel could be extended in the following ways:
## Live Data Integration
- Integrate validated public AMR surveillance datasets (e.g., national or global resistance reporting systems).
- Enable near real-time updates to resistance trends and anomaly detection.
## Advanced Agentforce Automation
- Automatically create Salesforce tasks or cases when critical risk thresholds are exceeded.
- Trigger notifications to R&D, clinical operations, or stewardship teams.
- Enable one-click escalation workflows directly from dashboards.
## Predictive Analytics
- Apply predictive modeling to forecast resistance trajectories.
- Estimate time-to-risk thresholds for high-impact drug classes.
- Support proactive trial design and geographic planning.
## Regulatory & Compliance Support
- Generate automated regulatory-ready summaries.
- Provide longitudinal resistance evidence to support submissions to regulatory agencies.
## Role-Based Experiences
- Tailor dashboard views for different personas (executive, clinical, stewardship).
- Restrict or expand detail levels based on user role.
## Expanded Portfolio Coverage
- Extend analysis beyond Phase III trials to include earlier development stages.
- Incorporate post-launch surveillance to support lifecycle management.
## AI-Driven Recommendations
- Enhance rule-based recommendations with data-driven insights.
- Identify protective factors associated with lower resistance risk.
- Continuously refine recommended actions based on outcomes.
